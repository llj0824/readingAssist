# Chrome Extension for Seamless Reading using Visual Pointer Cue.

Are you tired of scrolling through long digital documents or books and losing track of where you are? Do you ever find yourself re-reading the same sentence multiple times because you lost your spot?

We have a solution for you. We developed a **feature that selects and highlights the current sentence being read** as a visual cue for readers. This feature enhances the reading experience by providing clear cues on the sentence you are currently reading, helping you to maintain focus and engagement with the content.

## Empirical Studies on Impact of Visual Cues on Reading
 
1. Huestegge et al. (2009): In second-grade children with low reading fluency levels, the use of a finger significantly reduced word skipping rates by 42% and regression rates (re-reading words) by 61%. This study provides strong evidence that using a visual pointer can improve both reading speed and comprehension. 

2. Ben-Yehudah & Ahissar (2004): Showed that using an external aid like a moving window or finger-reading could improve reading fluency for struggling readers such as adult dyslexics. Participants showed an increase in reading speed of 25% when using a moving window technique compared to when they read without any external aid.

3. Schotter et al. (2014): Found that using an external device like a pen stabilizes gaze position during reading and reduces backward movements called regressionsâ€”a frequent cause of inefficiency when reading. They found that using an external device like a pen could reduce the number of regressions (backward eye movements) during reading by approximately 10%. 

4. Rayner et al.(2010): After six sessions of training with gaze-contingent display change technique, participants reduced their number of saccadic regressions from about 4 regressions per sentence to about 2 regressions per sentence on average, leading to increased reading efficiency.

5. Begeny, J. C., Krouse, H. E., Ross, S. G., & Mitchell, R. C. (2009): Students who participated in the HELPS program showed an average increase of 38.5 words correct per minute (WCPM) compared to students who did not participate, who only improved by an average of 13.3 WCPM over a 12-week period.

Using a pointer helps control the pace at which you read, making it easier to avoid subvocalization and supporting chunking as you focus on groups of words rather than individual words. By using a pointer, you provide your brain with a clear target for each fixation, effectively improving your reading speed and concentration. While these studies offer empirical evidence of improvements in reading speed and comprehension, it's important to note that individual results may vary depending on factors such as age, baseline skill level, learning disabilities, and consistency in practicing these techniques. Additionally, there is no one-size-fits-all solution; different strategies may be more effective for different people based on their unique circumstances and needs.

## Usage

Our feature is easy to use and seamlessly integrates with existing web applications. To select a sentence in an article, simply highlight a word or phrase, press **space bar**, and our feature will determine the current sentence based on cursor position and surrounding text. The chosen sentence will be highlighted in real-time as you scroll through the document.
