# Chrome Extension for Seamless Reading using Visual Pointer Cue.

Are you tired of scrolling through long digital documents or books and losing track of where you are? Do you ever find yourself re-reading the same sentence multiple times because you lost your spot?

We have a solution for you. We developed a **feature that selects and highlights the current sentence being read** as a visual cue for readers. This feature enhances the reading experience by providing clear cues on the sentence you are currently reading, helping you to maintain focus and engagement with the content.

## Video Demo


To see our feature in action and better understand its benefits, watch our video demonstration. This demo showcases how our sentence selection and highlighting feature functions and how it can significantly improve your reading focus.

## Usage

Our feature is easy to use and seamlessly integrates with existing web applications. To select a sentence in an article, simply highlight a word or phrase, press **space bar**, and our feature will determine the current sentence based on cursor position and surrounding text. The chosen sentence will be highlighted in real-time as you scroll through the document.
