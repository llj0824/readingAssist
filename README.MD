# Product Pitch: Introducing a Feature That Selects Sentences as Visual Cues for Digital Reading

Are you tired of scrolling through long digital documents or books and losing track of where you are? Do you ever find yourself re-reading the same sentence multiple times because you lost your spot?

We have a solution for you. Our team has developed a **feature that selects and highlights the current sentence being read** as a visual cue for readers. This feature enhances the reading experience by providing clear cues on the sentence you are currently reading, helping you to maintain focus and engagement with the content.

## Easy to Use and Seamless Integration

Our feature is easy to use and seamlessly integrates with existing web applications. Simply highlight a word or sentence on an article, and press **space bar** and our feature will determine the current sentence being read using the cursor position and surrounding text. The selected sentence will be highlighted in real-time as you scroll through the document.

## Improved Accessibility

Our feature also improves accessibility for users with visual or learning disabilities by providing a clear and intuitive user interface. It is perfect for students, professionals, or anyone who wants to improve their digital reading experience.

## Technology and Testing

Our team used **JavaScript** and **CSS** to create a custom user interface and leveraged existing open-source libraries like `DOM Range` and `Selection` to handle text selection and highlight specific elements in the text. We have extensively tested and refined this feature to ensure that it provides optimal functionality and an enjoyable user experience.
